    "For the general likelihood of the 2D power (or even 1D power), one needs to know the contribution to the power (and its uncertainty) from thermal noise. In fact, of course, the thermal noise is added in a non-Gaussian manner (same as everything else, really) because it is strictly positive. However, we assume that it is at least *close* to Gaussian, so that we can describe it purely by its mean and variance.\n",
