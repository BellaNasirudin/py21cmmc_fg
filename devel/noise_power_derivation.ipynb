    "For the general likelihood of the 2D power (or even 1D power), one needs to know the contribution to the power (and its uncertainty) from thermal noise. In fact, of course, the thermal noise is added in a non-Gaussian manner (same as everything else, really) because it is strictly positive. However, we assume that it is at least *close* to Gaussian, so that we can describe it purely by its mean and variance."

    "The other thing that is often assumed is that the thermal noise can be treated independently of all other signals in the chain (eg. EoR and FG). We will show that while this is a reasonable assumption when the expected power (from FG and EoR) is much less than the variance of the noise, it does not hold in general. Ignoring this fact leads to consistent under-estimation of the total variance of the power spectrum. We will first perform the calculation assuming that the FG, EoR and noise can be separated, before doing the full derivation."
