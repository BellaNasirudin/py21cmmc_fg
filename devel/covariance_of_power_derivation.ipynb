Some work has gone into this, especially in [Sellentin & Heavens (2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05969.pdf). However, it deals only with an unknown $\\sigma^2$, not an unknown mean. Apparently people are working on this currently. Regardless, whether or not we use updated forms, or just simply replace the true values with their estimated counterparts, we require the calculation of the estimated values."

    "One obvious way of calculating the estimated values would be to run several simulations per iteration of the MCMC, and manually calculate them. However, this is fairly poor computationally. However, we do have information about the distribution of $P$ within a single simulation, as we form $\\bar{P}_{u,\\eta}$ by summing over bins in the UV plane with $u^2 \\approx u^2 + v^2$. All of these bins are assumed to be statistically equivalent, and therefore tell us something about the distribution of their sum. In what follows, we determine how to calculate these two necessary quantities from the simulation data."
